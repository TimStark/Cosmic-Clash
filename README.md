## Übersicht
The Project contains a simple space shooter game where you have to hit the comets with lasers before they reach the world's bottom in order to get points and not to lose your lives. After a score of 100, you get a level-up resulting in a better spaceship, better lasers, a higher shoot-interval and a faster speed of the flying comets. To make the game more difficult, you can change the shoot-interval (Class Asteroid.java).  

Due to an internal error in Greenfoot, we sadly were not able to implement pictures in the code so we had to work with separated classes only created for the purpose of maintain a picture-change at a level-up.
